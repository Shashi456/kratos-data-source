Portuguese police have reportedly launched a search for Madeleine McCann's body in the Algarve.

The searches are taking place in Vila do Bispo, which is a 20 minute drive from Praia de Luz where the three-year-old went missing in 2007.

Compelling new evidence is said to have encouraged the new searches to take place.

According to Porteguese state broadcaster RTP, detectives have discovered 'fundamental evidence' linking suspect Christian Brueckner to Madeleine's disappearance.There are reports that the searches are being conducted in wells, but there has been no official response from Portugese police regarding these claims.
