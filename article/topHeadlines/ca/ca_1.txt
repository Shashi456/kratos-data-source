Interior Health has issued a sweeping warning about potential coronavirus exposure in downtown Kelowna and the waterfront recently.

On Friday, the health authority said anyone who attended gatherings in those areas between June 25 and July 6 could have been exposed to the virus.

Eight people have tested positive for COVID-19 after visiting restaurants and bars downtown and going to private gatherings, Interior Health said.

“Of specific concern are larger Canada Day and holiday weekend events,” it said in a news release.

“Given the number of cases and potential locations involved, we are urging anyone who

participated in events over these dates to monitor closely for symptoms of COVID-19.”

Six of those eight patients don’t live in the Interior Health region and were visiting for the Canada Day long weekend. Interior Health is working on contact tracing, and some people who are confirmed to have spent time with the infected individuals have already been contacted.

Anyone who develops coronavirus symptoms is encouraged to get tested, the health authority said. It cautioned against getting tested without symptoms because of the possibility for a false negative.

Symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, loss of sense of taste or smell, fatigue, body aches, and diarrhea.
