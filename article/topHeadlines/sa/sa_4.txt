Five people have been killed in a hostage situation at a Pentecostal church in South Africa Saturday.

Police and military who responded to reports of a shooting at the International Pentecostal Holiness Church headquarters in Zuurbekom near Johannesburg found four people “shot and burned to death in a car” and a security guard shot in another car.

It happened around 3 a.m. local time, according to reports. Police hostage negotiators were still on the scene hours later.

Police arrested 40 individuals. Six people have been injured.

Police say children were among those rescued. They say the attack by a group of armed people “may have been motivated by a feud” between church members.

More than 25 firearms have been seized, according to Reuters.
