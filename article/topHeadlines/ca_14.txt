These remain mysterious in themselves and would have taken place long ago.

The scientists report in their new paper the objects may also represent a new view of an already known phenomenon.

The objects could be the consequence of looking at the jets of a radio galaxy down the end, for instance, meaning they may appear circular because we are facing down the 'barrel' of the blast.

The astronomers also suggest the objects are possibly a variety of different things, which have been spotted at the same time because of new observational capabilities instead of representing a single category of discovered object.
