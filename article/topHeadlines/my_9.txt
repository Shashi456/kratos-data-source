KLANG: Kuantan MP Fuziah Salleh (pic) has been appointed as the new PKR women's wing chief.

She replaces Lembah Jaya assemblyman Haniza Talha, who was expelled from the party.

Fuziah and Haniza contested against each other in the last party polls, with the latter winning the post.

Haniza, was suspended from the party on April 6 for allegedly having a “clandestine” meeting with expelled PKR leaders led by former deputy president Datuk Seri Azmin Ali and vice president Zuraida Kamaruddin.

Haniza told The Star that the meeting was not clandestine, but was a gathering attended by many others.

She was eventually sacked from the party on June 29.

Haniza had said that among the reasons given for her sacking was a statement she made criticising the disciplinary board.

Others reasons given were that she was apparently using her new non-governmental organisation (NGO) Nation of Women to recruit PKR members.

PKR's women's wing does not have a deputy chief, as its incumbent, Sementa assemblyman Dr Daroyah Alwi left the party in early June, saying she had lost faith in the party leadership.
