Five people were injured in a brazen driveby shooting Friday night in the city’s west end.

Toronto Police say the gunfire erupted near Jane St. and Woolner Ave., north of St. Clair Ave., around 10:20 p.m.

It’s believed two people opened fire from a grey sedan.

“They were just indiscriminately shooting at individuals in this area,” Insp. Norm Proctor told reporters at the scene. “It’s completely reckless.”

“These individuals with no regard for human life just took it upon themselves to shoot out of their vehicle at anybody who was in that area,” he added.

The motive for the driveby was not immediately clear but Proctor said the victims were innocent bystanders.

A woman in her 50s, a man in his 30s and another man in his 40s were taken to hospital.

Two other victims made their own way to the hospital.

No suspect descriptions were immediately released but police say the suspect vehicle were last seen travelling east on Woolner Ave.

The driveby was one of at six shootings in the city Friday as gunplay continues to soar to new heights.

As of July 6 there had been 220 shootings with 96 victims, 22 of whom were killed, in Toronto this year.

Deputy Chief Shawna Coxon, who visited the shooting scene Saturday, said the two shooters just drove up to a gathering and opened fire. It’s believed one opened fire from the driver’s side of the car and the other was shooting from the passenger’s side. “It’s so concerning. It was a brazen shooting,” Coxon said. “We have five victims but there could have been so many more.” She said four of the victims’ injuries were minor but one victim remained in life-threatening condition. “It’s been violent in the city and it is very concerning,” Coxon said.
