Police have identified the suspect who uploaded a seditious post which was falsely attributed to former deputy minister for women, family and community development Hannah Yeoh, said Inspector-General of Police Abdul Hamid Bador.

Abdul Hamid said police investigations showed that the seditious posting had nothing to do with the Segambut member of Parliament but was made by the muafakatnasional.net portal.
