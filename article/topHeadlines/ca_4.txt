MONTREAL — Public health officials are urging anyone who has frequented a bar on the Island of Montreal since Canada Day to get a COVID-19 test after several cases stemming from drinking establishments.

Authorities said Saturday that several bar patrons and employees have tested positive since July 1 in an outbreak involving at least five area bars, despite public health measures put in place ahead of bars reopening in the province.

“I’m afraid these observations only reflect the tip of the iceberg,” said Dr. David Kaiser, a doctor with the Montreal public health department. “The pandemic is not behind us, community transmission is still very present in Montreal.”

Officials said they have spoken to bar owners and were able to reach some affected people, but not all. It’s possible some of those infected people may have gone to other bars.

Kaiser urged anyone starting to develop COVID-19 symptoms or those who’ve been in contact with someone get screened and tested.
