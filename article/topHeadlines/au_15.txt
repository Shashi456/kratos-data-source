Brooklyn Beckham has popped the question his girlfriend Nicola Peltz.

The 21-year-old photographer and son of Victoria and David Beckham is reportedly engaged to the 25-year-old Bates Motel actress according to The Mirror.

“Brooklyn has been telling his friends in LA that he and Nicola are engaged,” a source said.

“It’s common knowledge among their group of friends. They are smitten.”

The source said that Brooklyn's parents approved of their eldest child’s engagement.

“David and Victoria have very much given this relationship their blessing,” the source said.

“It’s a very exciting time for the whole family and after a few previous rocky relationships, they think Brooklyn has landed on his feet.”

The pair have been dating for about 10 months and make their relationship public in January when Brooklyn posted a black and white selfie of them in towels.

“Happy birthday babe xx you have such an amazing heart xx,” he captioned the photo.

The happy couple have been isolating together in New York since March.

“[Brooklyn] and Nicola are closer than ever and they are both excited to take their relationship to the next level by sharing the same home,” the source said.

The source added that Nicola was already considered part of the family.

“Nicola has been a big hit with the entire Beckham family — both David and Victoria have made it clear to Brooklyn how much they like her. So they completely support him in this move — though they will miss him a lot.”

Brooklyn has previously dated a number of high profile women including actress Chloe Moretz, French model and singer Sonia Ben Ammar and Pheobe Torrance who shares an uncanny resemblance with his mum and worked as a Posh Spice lookalike during university.

“A few of his friends have teased him about it but Brooklyn is adamant that there was nothing ‘Oedipal’ about it,” a source told The Sun in October last year.
