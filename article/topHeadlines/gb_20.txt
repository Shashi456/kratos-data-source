A British man has died after falling from the seventh floor balcony in a hotel in the Costa del Sol.

The man, thought to be roughly 50, fell onto a Spanish man on the terrace below who was also killed.

The Spaniard he fell on is thought to have been a local living in the upmarket resort of Marbella.

Police are trying to establish if the holidaymaker jumped or fell by accident.

The tragedy occurred at 1.45am this morning at the five-star Melia Don Pepe Hotel in Marbella.
