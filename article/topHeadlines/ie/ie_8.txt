A commemoration service honouring all those who lost their lives in World War I and World War II has been held at the Irish National War Memorial Gardens in Dublin.

The Joint Royal British Legion Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland wreath-laying ceremony marked the start of the Battle of the Somme and paid tribute to the estimated 60,000 Irish men and woman who lost their lives in both conflicts.

Due to restrictions, the socially distant ceremony was attended by about 50 people. Normally, the service is attended by around 1,000 people.

"This annual commemoration has increasingly disposed a shared Ireland philosophy," said Brian Duffy of the Royal British Legion (ROI).

"We remembered our shared loss together and honour the Battle of the Somme not as a story of them but truly as a story of us."

Minister of State Jack Chambers laid a wreath on behalf of the Irish Government.

National Day of Commemoration ceremonies to commemorate all those Irish men and women who died in past wars will be held tomorrow at Collins Barracks in Dublin, as well as at several other locations across the country.

Live coverage of the event begins on RTÉ One Television at 10.55am.
