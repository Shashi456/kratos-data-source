THE Philippine National Police Academy (PNPA) suspended all activities for new cadets due to the deaths of two plebes.

A female cadet, Fourth Class Jiary Jasen Papa, died due to hypokalemia on Friday morning, the PNP reported.

Hypokalemia is an electrolyte imbalance or low potassium intake.







Papa’s death comes three days after Cadet Fourth Class Kenneth Ross Alvarado died due to heat stroke.

In Papa’s logbook, she requested permission to go to the comfort room at 2:30 a.m. and later went back to sleep.

After waking up to prepare for the early morning activity, Papa collapsed beside her bunks, the report said.

Papa was brought to the Academy Health Service by duty cadets to give first aid, and was rushed to Qualimed Hospital in Sta Rosa, Laguna. Cadet Papa was declared dead by the attending physician at 4:34 a.m.

PMGen. Jose Chiquito Malayo, PNP Director, said all activities for the members of the PNPA Class of 2024 will be suspended until further evaluation and assessment.

PNP Chief Archie Francisco Gamboa expressed condolences to the bereaved family of Papa, and ordered the PNPA Administration to immediately submit the results of the investigation and inquiry to him.

The PNPA Medical Doctor and Administration informed Papa’s parents about her death, and assured them of financial assistance for new members of the PNPA Cadetship Program. This includes insurance protection and benefits from the Public Safety Mutual Benefit Fund, Inc (PSMBFI).

Papa’s body will undergo swab test for Covid-19 infection as part of health protocols, the Academy Health Service said.
