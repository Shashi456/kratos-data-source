One-way systems, pre-booked tickets, face coverings and social distancing.

The experience at London's National Gallery, which became the first of the major national museums to reopen to the public on Wednesday, is markedly different from the pre-pandemic wander-at-will affair.

Visitors can still see its collection of world-class paintings for free, but tickets have to be booked online for a specific day and time.

Face coverings and use of hand sanitiser stations are encouraged once inside the gallery, and visitors choose from one of three prescribed one-way routes: A, B or C (you can do them all if you want).

Each trail takes around 30 minutes and features hundreds of stunning paintings.

All three options are something of a smorgasbord of styles and epochs, but broadly speaking route A focuses on Italian paintings, route B is more Flemish and Dutch, and C is German and British.
