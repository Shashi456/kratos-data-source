During cross-examination, The Sun's lawyer, Sasha Wass, accused the star of throwing a champagne bottle at Heard during a fight after the party.

He disputed the account, insisting she had been "drinking heavily" during the party and attacked him while he was reading in bed, punching him in the face four times before he grabbed her arms to stop her.

Depp was also asked about whether he had accused his then wife or her friends of "defecating in the bed" after the argument and whether he joked about the incident with pals in texts by calling his wife 'Amber Turd'. The actor replied saying he did joke about the incident.

"It was one of the most absurd, unexpected statements that I have ever witnessed in my life so, yes, initially I did laugh because it was so strange," he said, adding that he believed it was her as she had told their building manager it was "just a harmless prank".

He said that it was "a mystery" who actually defecated but that it was not the couple's small dogs and that he believed it was either Heard herself or her friend, transgender activist iO Tillett Wright.

"I was convinced that it was either Ms Heard herself or one of her cohorts involved in leaving human faeces on the bed," he explained.

"iO Tillett Wright seemed the only one that would be crass enough to commit such an act."
