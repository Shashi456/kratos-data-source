NEW DELHI: When coronavirus claimed its first victim in Mumbai's Dharavi - India's largest slum - in April, many feared the virus would turn its narrow, congested streets into a graveyard, with social distancing or contact tracing all but impossible.But three months on, Mumbai's Dharavi has won praise from the WHO for the efforts taken to contain the spread of the Covid-19 The officials say that an aggressive strategy that focused on "chasing the virus, instead of waiting for disaster" helped them flatten the Covid-19 curve in Dharavi.The BMC faced several challenges in Dharavi but its approach to tackle the virus was focused on four Ts - tracing, tracking, testing and treating, say officials.The local civic body said proactive screening with the assistance of private doctors and community support helped it in the fight against the disease.But it was a challenge as Dharavi's 80 per cent population depends on 450 community toilets.About 8-10 people live in households or hutment that measures about 10/10 feet, coupled with existence of narrow lanes with two-three-storey houses where often the ground floor is a house and other floors are used as factories.Hence, there were severe limitations of physical distancing with no possibility of effective "home quarantine". So contact tracing was a huge task for the officials.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G North ward of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said the civic body had to change its traditional approach of waiting for patients, contact tracing, isolation and home quarantine to begin proactive screening instead."Proactive screening helped in early detection, timely treatment and recovery," he said.At least six to seven lakh people have been screened in Dharavi, while 14,000 persons were tested and 13,000 were placed in institutional quarantine with medical facilities and community kitchen for free," the senior official said.When infections started to rise fast and fewer than 50,000 people were checked for symptoms, officials needed to move quickly and get creative. And that is when they came up with "Mission Dharavi".Each day, medical workers set up a "fever camp" in a different part of the slum, so residents could be screened for symptoms and tested for coronavirus if needed.Doctors and private clinics, as part of proactive screening and fever camps, covered as many as 47,500 houses, while 14,970 people were screened in mobile vans, officials said.Apart from this, special care was taken for the elderly residents and 8,246 senior citizens were surveyed."We mobilised all private practitioners. At least 24 private doctors came forward and the civic body provided them with PPE kits, thermal scanners, pulse oxymetres, masks, gloves, and started door-to-door screening in high risk zones and all suspects were identified," officials said.Schools, wedding halls and sports complexes were repurposed as quarantine facilities that offered free meals, vitamins and "laughter yoga" sessions.Flattening the curve and achieving this monumental feat was not easy for the local authorities, who had to overcome their fair share of challenges.At least 80 per cent of Dharavi's population depends on 450 community toilets and the administration had to sanitise and disinfect these toilets several times a day.Social distancing was next to impossible in Dharavi, where families of eight to 10 people live in 10x10 hutments and residents have to walk along narrow lanes lined with crowded tenements on either side.Apart from the congested slum pockets, Dharavi, is also home to several small-scale leather, pottery and textile manufacturing units.The area has 5,000 GST-registered enterprises, 15,000 single-room factories and is a hub of international exports with an annual turnover of 1 billion USD.Strict containment measures were deployed in virus hotspots that were home to 125,000 people, including the use of drones to monitor their movements and alert police, while a huge army of volunteers swung into action, distributing rations so they didn't go hungry.There was a strict enforcement of lockdown in the containment zones, during which only critical patients were moved out of the area to other hospitals and 90 per cent were treated in Dharavi itself.Community participation was crucial to contain the spread of coronavirus in Dharavi and local community leaders were appointed as "Covid yoddhas" (warriors) to address the concerns.According to him, grocery kits and food packets were distributed in containment zones to prevent the movement of people and this helped in a big way.The efforts taken by the civic authorities and the local participation is evident from the doubling rate of the virus in Dharavi, which is spread over 2.5 sq km and has a population of 2,27,136 per sq km.According to the official data, while in April, the doubling rate was 18 days, it gradually improved to 43 days in May and slowed down to 108 and 430 days in June and July, respectively.As many as 2,359 Covid-19 cases have been recorded in Dharavi so far, of which 1,952 patients have recovered from the deadly infection, while there are only 166 active cases at present. World Health Organisation Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a virtual press conference in Geneva on Friday that there were many examples from around the world that have shown that even if the outbreak is very intense, it can still be brought back under control."And some of these examples are Italy, Spain and South Korea, and even in Dharavi - a densely packed area in the megacity of Mumbai," he had said.Ghebreyesus also underlined that only aggressive action combined with national unity and global solidarity can turn the COVID-19 pandemic around.He also stressed the importance of leadership, community participation and collective solidarity to control the virus.
