Police confirmed that Musitano, 52, died on the scene and a second unidentified victim is in hospital.

Halton police said they believe the suspect drove off in a newer model grey four-door sedan, similar to an Infiniti Q50 with a sunroof. They also warned that residents and businesses should expect a “heavy police presence” in the area as they appeal for witnesses to come forward with information.

Musitano’s death comes after an earlier attempt on his life failed in April 2019.
