This weekend, you can still get the biggest discount we’ve seen yet on Apple’s AirPods Pro truly wireless earbuds. The sale is happening at Verizon, and you can save $30 on a set of Apple AirPods Pro online only. Most discounts for this model are in the $15 to $20 range, but this deal at Verizon brings them down to their best-ever price of $220. The AirPods Pro are the best truly wireless earbuds for people who own an iPhone, according to The Verge’s Chris Welch. They sound great and pack in active noise cancellation, and specifically for those who own an iPhone, Apple Watch, or other Apple tech, they can quickly switch between playing audio on different devices.

Another notable deal comes from Best Buy where the GoPro Fusion 360-degree action camera is $230 for Saturday only, down from its usual $300 price. What makes this deal even better than just a mere price drop is that it includes a second battery and a battery charger, so you won’t be stranded without an extra battery during your trip out.

Ubisoft’s Forward game conference is this Sunday, July 13th, at 3PM ET / 12PM PT.
