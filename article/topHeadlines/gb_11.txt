Michail Antonio tore Norwich to shreds on Saturday afternoon to secure a 4-0 win for West Ham which confirmed the Canaries’ relegation back to the Championship.

The 30-year-old scored all FOUR of West Ham’s goals in the thrashing at Carrow Road to cap his stunning individual performance.

Tony Cascarino pays tribute to the great Jack Charlton - “He could walk on water in Ireland, and he loved it!

His first and final goals were both close-range finishes, while his second and third were netted with his head -and they have done much for West Ham in their bid for Premier League survival.

Antonio’s feat on Saturday was tremendously impressive, although he’s not the first footballer in Premier League history to reach such a number.

In fact, the Englishman is actually one of 27 players to score four in a single Premier League game, while only a handful have gone one step further and netted five.
